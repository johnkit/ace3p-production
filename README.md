# ACE3P Production

A collection of scripts and notes associated with building and packaging
modelbuilder for ACE3P users.

The files in `docs/` folder are configured as github pages, url
https://johnkit.github.io/ace3p-production/.

* The source files for the ui-testing web pages are generated in the `/test/ui` folder. Test specs are written in yml files in the `/test/ui/specs` folder. Run the compile_test to convert each yml file to a json file in the `/docs/ui-testing/data` folder and generated a `/docs/ui-testing/testNames.js` file.
