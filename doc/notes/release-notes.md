Revised templates to replace Category View with Analysis View,
and reorganizing the internal logic to better support all of the
TEM3P options.

Fixed known errors in ACE3P files generated by modelbuilder, mainly
in TEM3P.


Known issues:

* All ACDTool features are temporarily unavailable and will be added
  back in a future release.

* The TEM3P "Elastic Eigenmode" module still is implemented with the tab
  labeled "TEM3P Elastic". This will be addressed in a future release.

* Methods for coupling simulations still require finding the source
  directory on Cori. This will be addessed in a future release.
